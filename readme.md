## React | Rails full-stack developer

# What I do ?
## Design + Development
As a React/Rails developer, I might be building out projects, starting with a back-end API to a fully responsive user interface (UI). I created structured HTML & CSS code, I applied front-end best practices, I created UIs adjusted to given designs. I managed front-end data using a shared state pattern. My work requires a great deal of self-discipline and attention to detail, but that sort of balancing act is part of what makes the job fun for me.

## Back-end
With Ruby On Rails , I implemented basic OOP principles in Ruby, I designed DB schema based on real-life example, I used MVP to structure backend code, I implemented basic CRUD operations, active Record associations to model real-life system and a RESTful API with proper routes and applied back-end best practices, I sent and received data from a back-end endpoint. I Created tests for new features and models.

## Remote + Pairing
Meeting with international people, mentoring students, communicating and collaborating with remote developers, discussing timelines, achievements, and goals in daily stand-ups, allowed me to provide and receive feedback collaboratively and in a constructive manner, develop skills in remote pair-programming, using GitHub, industry-standard git flows.
